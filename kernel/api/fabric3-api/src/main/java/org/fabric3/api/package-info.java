/**
 * Overview of fabric3 Application Programming Interface.
 *
 * This package contains classes and annotations intended for use by application code.
 * In general, the programming models supported by fabric3 are designed to be
 * non-intrusive. The goal is for application code to be portable to any framework
 * supporting an Inversion of Control style programming model and as such does
 * not require application code to inherit from framework classes or to implement
 * framework specific interfaces. Where additional information is required by the
 * framework, Java annotations are used.
