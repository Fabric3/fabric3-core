This file contains build instructions for the ZMQ and JZMQ dynamic link libraries for various operating systems.

Windows 7 x64
______________________
JZMQ was built against libzmq 2.1.7. Both the ZMQ and JZMQ libraries were built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 targeted to 64-bit architectures.
Note the Visual Studio solution distributed with JZMQ needed to be modified to include a 64-bit target with updated ZMQ library dependencies (dynamic
and static libraries). Also, projected type needed to be changed from Application (EXE) to Dynamic Link Library.


OS X
______________________

JZMQ was built against libzmq 2.1.7 installed using Homebrew. The JZMQ dylib was modified with instal_name_tool to make the dependency path to
libzmq.0.dylib relative using @loader_path. This allows the libzmq.dylib library to load the libzmq.0.dylib library without the need to place the
latter in usr/local or set the DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable on runtime startup.

The following otool and instal_name_tool commands were used:

$ otool -L libjzmq.dylib

libjzmq.dylib:
	/usr/local/lib/libjzmq.0.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
	/usr/local/Cellar/zeromq/2.0.10/lib/libzmq.0.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
	/usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 7.9.0)
	/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 125.2.1)

$ install_name_tool -change /usr/local/Cellar/zeromq/2.0.10/lib/libzmq.0.dylib @loader_path/libzmq.0.dylib libjzmq.dylib

$ otool -L libjzmq.dylib

libjzmq.dylib:
	/usr/local/lib/libjzmq.0.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
	@loader_path/libzmq.0.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
	/usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 7.9.0)
	/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 125.2.1)
